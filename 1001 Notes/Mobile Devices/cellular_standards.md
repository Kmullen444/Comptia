### Cellular network

#### Mobile devices
- "Cell" phones

#### Separate land into "cells"
- Antnna coverages a cell with certain frequencies

#### Some of the original cellular networks were called 2G networks
- Consisted of 2 global standards
-		GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications
-		CDMA - Code Division Mutiple Access
-	Both were good for voice communications but poor data support
-		Originally usd circuit-switching
-		Minor upgreades for some packet-switching to allow some type of data connectivity

### GSM 

#### Global System for Mobile Communications
- Mobile networking standard

#### Was about 90% of the market
- Originally an EU standard
- Allowed you to have coverage Worldwide

#### Used by AT&T and T-Mobile in the US
- Move yor SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) from phone to phone

#### Original GSM standard used mutiplexing
- Everyone gets a little slice of time
- Allowed mutiple people to perform voice communications, data communications and combine all across one single area

### CDMA

#### Code Division Mutiple Access
- Everyone communicationsat the same time
-  Each call uses a different code
-  the codes are used to filter each call on the receiving side

#### Used by Verizon and Sprint
- Handsets are controlled by the network provider
- Not much adoption elsewhere in the world

### 3G Technology

#### 3rd Generation
- Inroducded in 1998

#### Upgraded data connectitity over 2G
- Incremental 3G updates improved speeds
- Usually serveral megabits per second

#### Bandwidth improvenment allowed new functionality
- GPS
- Mobile Television
- Video on demand

### 4G and LTE

#### Long Term Evolution (LTE)
- A "4G" technology
- Converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers combined)
- Based on GSM and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
- Standard supports download rates of 150 megabits per second (Mbit/s)

#### LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
- In some areas you may find an upgraded version of LTE
- Standard supports download rates of 300 Mbit/s

### 5G

#### Fifth Generation cellular networking
- Launched worldwide in 2020

#### Significant performance improvenments
- At higher frequencies
- Eventually 10 gigabits per second
- Slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s

#### Significant IoT(Internet of Things) impact
- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint
- Larger data transfers
- Faster monitoring and notification
- Additional cloud processing

### Updates

#### PRL updates
- Preferred Roaming list
		- Allows your phone to be conntected to the right tower
			- Can be updated over the air (OTA)
			- CDMA networks (ie. Verizon, Sprint)

### Hotspot

#### Turn your phone into a WiFi hotspot
- Creates you won personal wireless router
- Extend the cellular data network to all of you devices 
-		Allow any devices that require 802.11 connectivity to connect to the internet

### Dependent on phone type and provider
- Using this may require additional chares and data costs
