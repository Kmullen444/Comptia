### Laptop Hardware
- Enginerred to percise specifications
	- Challenging to repair
- Some laptops are easier to repair than others
	- An ongoing learning process
	- May specialize in a single laptop becuase that's the one most used by your company
	- Many manufactures may provide information about the laptop and how to repair it
- Understand the process
	- The details will vary between laptop manufactures

### Laptop Batteries
- The power source when unplugged
	- May be easily replace or require a teardown of the laptop
	- Can be the difference between five minutes or one hour	
- Most common battery types
	- Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) and Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo)
		- These batteries have no "memory effect"
			- Limiting the amout of charges that battey has
		- Charging the battery diminishes capacity
- Different form factor for each laptop
	- if you need to replace the battery make sure that it is the one for that laptop
	- Battery tech is always changing
			
### Laptop Keyboard
- Most-used component of the laptop
	- Can be easy to replace
	- Few screws and a single ribbon cable
		- May not always be this simple
- Or connect an external USB keyboard
	- Not portable but works in a pinch 
- As they become smaller there isn't as much space for all of the keys
	- Usually uses layers to get everything on the keyboard
			
### Laptop Keys
- Some repairds might require the removal or replacement of a keycap
- Check with the namufacturer's instructions so nothing is damaged
		- It's very easy to accidentally break the key cap or the componets underneath
		
### Laptop Memory
- If you need to upgrade the non-permanent memory, you'll probably want to replace it with SO-DIMM 
#### Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module (SO-DIMM)
- Memory used in laptops and moblie devices
	- often easy to install and replace through a window under the laptop (check To Install)
- Some memory is soldered to the system board
	- Not upgradeable
	- Requires a full system board replacement
- To install
	- Open back or "window"
	- place it in the correct spot
	- push it in and then down
			
### Laptop Storage
- Magnetic Disk
	- Traditional spinning drive platters
	- 2.5 form facter (3.5 inches for desktop)
- SSD (Solid-state drive)
	- All memory, no moving parts
	- Silent, fast access time, less latency
	- 2.5 inch form factors, if upgrading from magnetic disk to SSD should be very easy
- M.2
	- Smaller form factor
	- No SATA data ro power cables (Magnetic Drives and SSDs have these)
	- Easy to install
			
### Replacing Laptop Storage
- All Internal
	- Open a cover on the back
	- Open the entire laptop
- Can be very modular
	- Two screws and the drive slides out
	- To install new one
		- Remove screws and cable to old drive
		- Replace cable then slot in the new drive
- M.2 drives are even easer
	- One screw
	- Similar to RAM installation 
			
### Migration from HDD to SSD
- Impressive upgrade
	- Move from spinning mechanical drive to solid state memory
	- It's almost like getting a new laptop
- Install an OS on the SSD
	- Move user documents between drives
	- Install any required applications
	- Can be time consuming
- Image/clone the HDD
	- No OS installation required
	- Move everything from oen to other
- Imaging software needed
	- Sometines included with the SSD
	- Many commercal and open source options
- Create an image file 
	- One drive at a time
	- Some companies may create a single OS image and use that across mutilple systems
- Drive-to-drive image
	- Image directly form one drive to the other
		- Taking everything from one system and sector by sector copying the data to the new system
		- Requires either 2 sperate systems or a system that can have multiple drives at once
				
### 802.11 wireless and Bluetooth
- Wireless network connectivity
	- Connect without wires
- 802.11
	-  Local Area network (LAN)
	-  High speed
	-  Internet access
	-  To remove/replace
	-  Usually very modular
		-  remove cover on the back of the laptop which will give you access to the Mini PCI or Mini PCI Express interfaces
		-  Slid into slot and push down
		-  If the card has antenna connection, connect them aswell
-  Bluetooth
	-  Personal area network (PAN)
	-  Short range
	-  Connect peripherals an othe nearby devices
-  WWAN (Wireless Wide Area Network) 
	- Allow you to connect to celluar services 

### Biometrics (relatively secure)
-	Sign in or unluck your laptop with a fingerprint reader or face recognition
-	Requires additional configuration in the OS
	-	Hardware required for most options
		-	Webcam or fingerprint reader

### Near-field communication (NFC)
- Short-distance networking
	- 4 centimeters or less
	- Data transfers or authenication
- Common on mobile phones and smart watches
	- Payment method on your wrist
- use it for authentication without typing a password 
	- Hospital workstations
	- Warehouses 
	- Manufacturing
