### Satellite networking

#### Communication to a satellite
- Non-terrestrial communication (not on earth)

#### High cost relative to terrestrial networking
- 50 Mbit/s down, 3 Mbit/s up are common
- Usually used in remote sites, difficult-to-network sites

#### High latency
- 250 ms up, 250 ms down
- Startlink advertises 40 ms and is working on 20 ms

#### Operates in high frequencies - 2 GHz
- Requires line of sight and have rain fade due to clouds and rain blocking the connection

### Fiber

#### High-speed data communication
- Frequencies of light

#### Higher installation cost than copper
- Equipment is more costly
- More difficult to repair
- Communicate over long distances

#### Large installation in the WAN core 
- Supports very high data rates
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing

#### Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
- Business and home use

### Cable broadband

#### Broadband
- Transmission across multiple frequencies
- Different traffic types

#### Data on the "cable" network
- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification)

#### High-speed networking
- 50 Mbit/s through 1,000+ Mbit/s are common

#### Multiple services
- Data, voice, video

### DSL

#### ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses Telephone lines

#### Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
- 200 Mbit/s downstream / 20 Mbit/s upstream are common
- ~10,000 foot limitation form the central office (CO)
- Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO

### Cellular Networks

#### Mobile devices 
- "Cell" phoes

#### Separate land into "cells"
- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies

#### Tethering
- Turn your phone into a wireless router (usually done through a physical connection)

#### Mobile hotspot
- Standalone devices
- Use your phone for other things

### WISP

#### Wireless Internet Service Provider
- Terrestrial internet access using wireless

#### Connect rural or remote locations
- Internet acccess for everyone

#### Many different deployment technologies
- Meshed 802.11
- 5G home internet 
- Proprietary wireless

#### Need an outdoor antenna
- Speeds can range from ~ 10 to 1,000 megabits per second
