### Cable crimpers

#### "Pinch" the connector onto a wire
- These wires include Coaxial, twisted pain, fiber

#### Connect the modular connector to the Ethernet cable
- Modular connectors include RJ45
- The final step of running new cable process

#### Metal prongs are pushed through the insulation
- The plug is also permanently pressed onto the cable sheath

### Crimping best-practices

#### Get a good crimper
- And a good pair of electrician's scissors/cable snips
- And a good wire stripper

####Make sure you use the corrct modular connectors
- Each type of wire will have a specific connector to go with it
- Differences between wire types

#### Practice, Practice, Practice
- It won't take long to become proficient

### WiFi analyzer

#### Wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor
- Everyone "hears" everything

#### Purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on
- Specialized in 802.11 analysis

#### Identify errors and interference
- Validate antenna location and installation

### Tone generator 

#### Toner probe
- Where does that wire go? 
- Follow the tone

#### These consist of 2 parts

#### Tone generator
- Puts an analog sound on the wire

#### Inductive probe
- Doesn't need to touch the copper 
- Hear through a small speaker

### Using the tone generator and probe

#### Easy wire tracing
- Even in complex environments

#### Connect the tone generator to the wire through
- Modular jack
- Coax
- Punch down connectors

#### Use the probe to locate the sound
- The two-tone sound is easy to find

### Punch down tool

#### "Punch" a wire into a wiring block
- 66 block, 110 block, and others

#### Can be tedious
- Every wire must be individually punched

#### Trims the wires during the punch
- Very efficient process

### Punch-down best-practices

#### Organization is key
- Lots of wires
- Cable management

#### Maintain your twists
- Your Category 6A cable will thank you later

#### Document everything
- Written documentation
- Tags
- Graffiti

### Cable testers

#### Relatively simple
- Continuity test
- A simple wire map

#### Can identify missing pins
- Or crossed wires

#### Not usually used for frequency testing
- Crosstalk, signal loss, etc.

### Loopback plugs

#### Useful for testing physical ports
- Or fooling your applications
- Data is transfer to the plug then directly back to the port
-   The data can then be checked to see if they match

#### Serial / RS-232 (9 pin or 25 pin)

#### Network connections
- Ethernet, T1, Fiber

#### These are not cross-over cables

### Taps and port mirrors

#### Intercept network traffic
- Send a copy to a packet capture device

#### Physical taps
- Disconnect the link, put a tap in the middle
- Can be an active (copper cable, requires power) or passive (fiber, doesn't require power) tap

#### Port mirror
- Port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port ANalyzer)
- Software-based tap
- Limited functionality, but can work well in a pinch
