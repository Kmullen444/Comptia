### Wireless standards

#### Wireless networking (802.11)
- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802)

#### Many updates over time
- Check with IEEE for the lastest

#### The Wi-Fi trademark
- Wi-Fi Alliance handles interoperability testing


### 802.11a

#### One of the original 802.11 wireless standards
- Launched in October 1999

#### Operates in the 5 GHz range
- Or other frequencies with special licensing

#### Speeds of 54 magabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Might not seem fast now but at the time those speeds on a wireless network were good

#### Smaller range than 802.11b
- The higher frequency of 802.11a tends to be absorbe by objects in the way

#### Not commonly seen today

### 802.11b (not an upgrade from 802.11a)

#### Also an original 802.11 standard
- Launched in October 1999

#### Operates in the 2.4 GHz range

#### Better range than 802.11a
- Lower frequency means less absorption problems
- Better in places with a lot of things ie. an office

#### More devices use this frequency and you have more frequency conflict
- Baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Bluetooth

#### Not commonly seen today

### 802.11g

#### An "upgrade" to 802.11b
- Launched in June 2003

#### Operates in the 2.4 GHz range

#### Speeds of 54 magabits per second (Mbit/s)
- Similar to 802.11a

#### Backwards-compatible with 802.11b

#### Has the same 2.4 GHz frequency conflict problems as 802.11b

### 802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)

#### Update to 802.11g, 802.11b, 802.11a
- Launched in October 2009

#### First to use the Wi-Fi standard naming system

#### Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz if acess point supports both
- 40 MHz channel width (more data can be transfered)

#### 600 magabits per second (Mbit/s)
- You get this with a device with 40 MHz mode and 4 antennas

#### 802.11n uses MIMO
- Multiple-input multiple-output
-   Multiple transmit and receive antennases

### 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)

#### Approved in January 2014
- Significant improvements over 802.11n

#### Operates in the 5 GHz band
- Less crowded, more frequencies (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)

#### Increased channel bonding
- Larger bandwidth usage

#### Denser signaling modulation
- Faster data transfers

#### Has eigth MU-MIMO (Multiple-user Multiple-input Multiple-output)
- Twice as many streams as 802.11n
- Nearly 7 gigabits per second

### 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)

#### Approved in February 2021
- The successor to 802.11ac/Wi-Fi 5

#### Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
- 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channel widths

#### 1,201 magabits per second per channel
- Relatively small increase in throughput
- Eight bi-directional MU-MIMO (Multiple-user Multiple-input Multiple-output) streams

#### Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
- Works similar to cellular communication
- Improves high-density installations
- If you're in an area with lots of devices, ie. sporting events, trade shows
-   802.11ax has much less interferences than pervious 802.11 standards

### Long-range fixed wireless

#### Wireless access point in house with the stock antennas
- You might get a range of 40 to 50 meters

#### Try connecting two buildings located miles from each other
- Fixed directional antennas and increased signal strength are needed

#### Outdoor
- There is minimal signal absorption or bounce

#### Directionl antennas 
- Focused, point-to-point connection

### Long-range fixed wireless

#### Wireless regulations are complex
- Refer to your country's regulatory agency first

#### Frequency use
- Unlicensed 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequencies
- Additional frequencies may be available
- Additional licensing may be required

#### Signal strength
- Indoor and outdoor power is usually regulated

#### Outdoor antenna installation is not trivial
- Get and expert, be safe

### RFID (Radio-frequency identification)

#### It's everywhere
- Access badges
- Inventory/Assembly line tracking
- Pet/Animal identification
- Anything that needs to be tracked

#### Radar Technology
- Radio energy transmitted to the tag
- RF (Radio Frequency) powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
- Bidirectional communication
- Some tag formats can be active/powered

### NFC (Near field communication)

#### Two-way wireless communication
- Builds on RFID, which is mostly one-way

#### Payment systems 
- Major credit cards
- Online wallets

#### Bootstrap for other wireless
- NFC helps with Bluetooth pairing

#### Accecc token, identity "card"
- Short range with encryption support
