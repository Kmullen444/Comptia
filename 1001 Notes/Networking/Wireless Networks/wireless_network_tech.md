### 802.11 technologies

#### Frequency
- 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz
- And sometimes both

#### Channels 
- Groups of frequencies, numbers by the IEEE
- Non-overlapping channels would be ideal

#### Regulations
- Most contries have regulations to manage frequency use
- Spectrum use, power output, interfereence requirements, etc.

### Band selection and bandwidth

#### 2.4 GHz Secptrum for 802.11 - North America
- Has 3 IEEE channels that allow for communication (sending of data)
-   1,6, 176

#### 5 GHz Secptrum for 802.11 - North America
- Has more options for communication
-   36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 6, 60, 64, 100, 104, 108, 112, 116, 120, 124, 128, 132, 136, 140, 144, 149, 153, 157, 161, 165
- Also has channels not available to 802.11
-  68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96, 196, 173, 177

### Bluetooth

#### Remove the wires
- Headsets
- Speakers
- Keyboards/Mice

#### Uses the 2.4 GHz range
- This range is the Unlicensed ISM
-   (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band
- 802.11 also used this range

#### Short-range
- Most consumer devices operate to about 10 meters
- Industrial Bluetooth devices can communicate over 100 meters
