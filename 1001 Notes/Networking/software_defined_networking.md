### SDN (Software Defined Networking)

#### Takes the functions of physical devices and turn the into applications to use <br> in the cloud

#### Networking devices have different functional planes of operation
- Data, control, and management planes

#### Splitthe functions into seperate logical units
- Extend the functionality and management of a single device
- Perfectly built for the cloud

### SDN layers

#### Infrastructure layer/Data plane 
- Process the network frames and packets
- Forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT (Network Address Translation)

#### Control layer/Control plane
- Manages the actions of the data plane
- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
- Dynamic routing protocol updates

#### Application layer/Management plane
- Configure and manage the device
- SSH, browser, API (Application Programming Interface) are ex. of this layer
