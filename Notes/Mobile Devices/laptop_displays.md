## Laptop Diplays

### Portable LCD

#### Liquid crystal display (LCD)
- Light shines through liquid crystals associated with color filters

#### Advantages
- Lightweight
- Relatively low power
- Relatively inexpensive

#### Disadvantages
- Black levels are a challenge
- Requires separate backlight
	- Florescent, LCD, etc.
	- Lights are difficult to replace

### LCD Technologies

#### TN (Twisted Nematic) LCD
- The original LCD techonlogy
- Fast response times (great for gaming)
- Poor viewing angles - *color shift* (need to be looking head on)

#### IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
- Excellent color representation (great for graphic, video/picture editing)
- Most expensive to produce than TN (Twisted Nematic)

#### VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
- Good compromise between TN(Twisted Nematic) and IPS (In Plane Switching)
- Good color representation
- Slower response times than TN

### OLED

#### Organic Light Emmiting Diode
- Organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current 

#### Thinner and lighter
- Flexible and moblie - no glass needed

#### No backlight
- The organic compound provides the light

#### Usually found on Tablets, phones, smart watches
- Very accurate color representation
- A bit higher cost than LCD

### Wi-Fi Antennas

#### Multiple antennas
- Since this is the highest point of the laptop, this is a great place to put <br> Wifi and bluetooth antennas
- Wifi main and Aux
- Bluetooth

#### Antenna wires wrap around teh laptop screen
- When replacing a screen you need to make sure that the they follow the same path <br> the previous wires too


### Webcam

#### Video Capture
- Built-in camera and microphone 

#### Usually includes both audio and video
- Specialized drivers and software

#### Microphones
- Built-in to the laptop dislay (usually found where the webcam is)

#### Not good for not-casual use 
- Don't have the best sound quality
- Analog or USB microphone can help when better quality is needed

### Fluorescent vs. LED backlighting

#### CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp
- Higher voltage and power needed than LED backlights
- Added thickness to the display
- No longer a common backlight
- Older laptops will use these

#### LED-backlit LCD display
- Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent
- LEDs around the edge of the screen or in a matrix
- The latest laptops are LED-backlit
- So common that sometimes people refer to them as an LCD backlit instead of LED-backlit
- These displays are smart enough to know what parts of the screen should be lighter <br> or darker

### Backligth and inverter

#### LCD displays need a backlight
- Fluorescent lamp/LED to LCD display to your eyes
- Used to convert DC current from the laptop to the AC that's needed to run the display

#### Verify backlight
- One way to tell if your backlight has failed is shine a light on the screen
	- Look closely and if you can see something it's most likely the backlight

#### May need to replace the LCD inverter or display if it's a backlight issue
- Make sure to choose the correct one for that laptop (check with manufacturer) and make sure you don't have replace the whole screen

### Digitizer

#### Use a pen-like device as input
- Stylus input
- Useful for graphical input

#### Used commonly on laptop/tablets or hybrid devices

### Touchscreeen

#### Merge lapto and tablet input
- Digitizer responds to touch
- No keyboard required
- But ofter a keyboard is still available

#### These devices usually have many options for input
- You can use the best one for the job
